  <p>Dear {{ loan.user.first_name }} {{ loan.user.last_name }},</p>

  <p>
    We have carefully reviewed your loan application and regret to inform you
    that we are unable to approve your request at this time.
  </p>

  <table class="details-table">
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Application Date:</strong></td>
      <td>{{ loan.application_date.strftime('%B %d, %Y') }}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Requested Amount:</strong></td>
      <td>GHS {{ "%.2f"|format(loan.amount) }}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Our decision was based on one or more of the following factors:</p>

  <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      • Credit Assessment: Current credit score or credit history does not meet
      our lending criteria
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      • Loan Qualification: The requested amount exceeds our current lending
      parameters for your profile
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      • Information Verification: Some information provided could not be
      verified or requires additional documentation
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      • Existing Commitments: Current outstanding loans or financial obligations
      affect eligibility
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      • Guarantor Status: Unable to secure the required guarantor approval for
      the loan
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>We encourage you to:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      • Schedule a consultation with our financial advisors to discuss your
      options
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      • Review and update your financial information
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      • Consider applying for a different loan amount or product that might
      better suit your current situation
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You are welcome to reapply after 3 months, during which time we recommend
    working with our financial advisory team to strengthen your application.
